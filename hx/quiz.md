# The standout few quiz

## **The Standout Few Quiz**

### **Headline**

**You found it.**

### **Subhead**

**Ten questions. A small experiment in how people think, decide, and build - not unlike how we do things around here.**

Extra copy: 

Our quiz takes about 5 minutes. You might pause on one or two questions - that’s the point.

At hx, experiments don’t always lead to answers. Sometimes, they just make better questions - or better conversations when we meet.

### **Body Copy on the careers site - leading to the quiz**

We made this because we like **games, puzzles, and the moment you realise what kind of problems bring out your best.**

It’s quick, intentional, and built to surface the small judgments behind great work — the kind we obsess over.

It takes about 5 minutes. You might pause on one or two questions, that’s the point.

At hx, experiments don’t always lead to answers. Sometimes, they just make better questions, or better conversations when we meet.

### **Tone summary**

- **Purpose:** Fun and thought-provoking; a *light experiment* that reflects hx’s way of working.
- **Voice:** Smart, human, lightly self-aware, quietly confident.
- **Emotion:** Curious, slightly playful, intellectually warm.
- **No “culture fit” language** - instead, it’s about perspective, problem-solving, and curiosity.

---

### **Quiz structure summary**

- **10 questions** total (each situational, role-agnostic, subtle).
- **5 archetypes**:
    - *Shaper* – how you create movement.
    - *Refiner* – how you handle standards and structure.
    - *Experimenter* – how you learn and adapt.
    - *Balancer* – how you weigh perspectives.
    - *Uplifter* – how you support and connect.

Each archetype appears as **Primary** in 2 questions and **Secondary** in 2, for accuracy.

- **Scoring:**
    - A = poor fit (0)
    - B = low fit (0.5)
    - C = good fit (1.0)
    - D = excellent fit (1.6)
    - E = overplayed fit (1.0 + overplay flag)

Primary = full value, Secondary = half.

Low overall alignment → neutral reflection; high overplay → “high-intensity insight” result.

Asks for Ash:

- Verify whether the questions are neutral enough and not too leading
- Are these the best questions? Are the options to answer differentiated well enough
- the number of questions - is it a good number
- Read the archetypes - are they best they can be?

### **Archetype weighting**

Each question contributes to **one Primary archetype** and **one Secondary archetype**:

- Primary = **100% of value**
- Secondary = **50% of value**

After all answers, each archetype’s points are summed, then normalised.

---

### **Result logic**

1. **Highest score → Primary archetype**
2. **Second-highest → Secondary archetype**
3. If all archetypes score low → Neutral Result
4. If multiple E answers → High-intensity Insight

## **THE SHAPER**

**You create movement.**

You’re the person who sees standstill and starts something. You notice what isn’t working, you see where momentum gets stuck, and you act -not recklessly, but with intent. Shapers are often the spark in the room: the ones who start things, unstick things, and help others see what’s possible.

You don’t wait to be asked. You lean in. You make things real.

At hx, Shapers help us stay fast, focused, and inventive. They’re the ones who keep us building forward instead of circling the same ideas.

**How to use this insight:**

Lean into moments where speed matters and ambiguity is high - that’s where you thrive.

---

## **THE REFINER**

**You raise the standard.**

You see the details that make good work great. You’re the person who quietly strengthens systems, improves processes, and helps teams avoid avoidable mistakes. Refiners don’t slow things down, they sharpen things.

You balance clarity with discipline, precision with practicality.

At hx, Refiners protect quality in a world that moves quickly. You’re the reason our work holds up under pressure, scales cleanly, and feels considered.

**How to use this insight:**

Own the moments where others might rush, that’s where your judgment shines.

---

## **THE EXPERIMENTER**

**You learn by making.**

Your instinct is to try, build, test, and adapt. You don’t get stuck in theory because you know progress comes from contact with reality. Experimenters push boundaries, not for ego, but to learn what works.

You see feedback as fuel, not friction.

At hx, Experimenters help us discover new paths, rethink old ones, and stay curious even under pressure. You’re the reason systems evolve instead of ossify.

**How to use this insight:**

Take the first swing. Show the rough version. Let learning drive the next.

---

## **THE BALANCER**

**You bring the centre of gravity.**

You know how to listen, weigh perspectives, and make decisions that respect both the problem and the people. Balancers don’t take the loudest path, they take the right one.

You hold steady in complexity. You’re the bridge.

At hx, Balancers bring judgment that teams rely on. You help us commit, unblock, and move forward with alignment, without losing the edges that make work interesting.

**How to use this insight:**

Step in when things feel knotty, you help teams find clarity.

---

## **THE UPLIFTER**

**You make people better.**

You help others rise, not by taking over, but by giving them confidence, direction, and the kind of support that compounds. Uplifters are the reason teams feel safe enough to push harder, learn faster, and grow together.

You’re generous, grounded, and intentional.

At hx, Uplifters help build teams people actually want to work in. You’re the culture carriers, the ones who create momentum through trust.

**How to use this insight:**

Lean into moments where someone needs a hand, your presence lifts the whole system.
