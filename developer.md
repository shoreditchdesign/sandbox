**Role:** Front-end Developer

**Location:** Hybrid with a minimum 3 days a week in the office in Shoreditch, London.

Shoreditch Design is looking for a talented Front-end Developer to join their team at their London HQ.

### Shoreditch Design

We're a mixed-specialism design agency based in the heart of Shoreditch. We pride ourselves on our no-nonsense approach and silver-service quality. We've got big ambitions over the next few years and believe a vibrant, supportive studio culture is essential to our success.

At Shoreditch, we:

- Foster collaboration and teamwork. Everyone's ideas are valuable. We actively encourage ideation and critique at every step – no egos here.
- Value honest, open communication. We strive for excellence in every aspect of our work – from the deliverables to the design process and business development.
- Don't forget to have fun! We work hard and play hard, with team activities, monthly socials, and company trips from the Alps to Ibiza.

### The Role

We're looking to hire a talented and flexible Front-end Developer to join our web team.

- You love collaborating with designers to turn Figma files into production‑ready experiences, whilst preserving functionality and scalability.
- You bring ideas to life, pitch designers towards constraints, and propose novel approaches to web animation and storytelling - adding details that elevate the work and push the limits of what's possible.
- You're platform agnostic - You're not married to a specific solution, but instead use your craft in code to seamlessly ease into systems as the business deems fit.
- You care about systems - building information architecture that is scalable, providing the best UX for content editors, and future-proof for businesses in the long run.
- You understand websites are more than about code - you care about accessibility, best practices, and SEO performance that helps a build achieve its full potential.
- You're a clear communicator and a team player - keeping design teams and ops in the loop, estimating timelines, flagging blockers, and taking control of builds from handover to launch.
- You're kind, but opinionated. You bring options to the table and challenge our designers to be the best.

### Essential skills and experience

- Have 2+ years experience building production websites, ideally in an agency or studio environment.
- Have experience working with cross-functional teams, and translating Figma Design Systems to code.
- Use Git daily, and have a really good understanding of version control.
- Are fluent in modern JavaScript with React and Next.js, and comfortable with GraphQL / RestAPI.
- Work efficiently with TailwindCSS, design tokens, and component libraries.
- Have hands-on experience with Headless CMSs such as Sanity, Prismic, or using WordPress headlessly, including content modelling, editor UX, and other functionality such as SEO and Asset Optimization.
- Equally invested in web accessibility and shipping experiences that are functional and performant, measuring and improving with tools like PageSpeed.
- Can integrate advanced animation and graphics libraries such as WebGL, Lottie, and Rive wherever suited.
- Can take the lead in motion design for websites, using tools like GSAP, Framer Motion, or native CSS where it makes sense.
- Are comfortable leveraging AI tools like Claude Code and Cursor to accelerate workflows without compromising quality.


Good to have
- WordPress as a Headless CMS system is something you've worked with before.
- Creative technologies like WebGL, Three.JS, React Three Fiber, and other related libraries are in your arsenal.
- You've used MCP and similar technologies to accelerate workflows for design, code, and content migration.
- DevOps experience including GitHub Actions, Serverless Setups, and Cron Jobs is a good plus.
